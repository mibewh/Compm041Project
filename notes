1. what do they mean by "average CTR cases"
    - logical way to seperate it is by advertisers, right now just averaging across the whole set
2. what is the bid price for the average CTR cases
    - should we be looking at bid price or pay price
        - bid price may be more relective of what the advertisiers value the ad spot at


What have we done:
- switching from linear regression to logistic regression to account for the binary output (click or no click)
- one-hot encoding of the categorical data
	- although they had numerical data (i.e. a region would be labeled as 80), this holds little meaning and gives
		certain points undeserved importance over others
	- by switching to the one-hot encoding, treat everything in the same category as the same
- tackled malformed data by treating it as another category/field
- Selecting the k best features to eleiminate uncorrelated features (and to speed up learning time)

Future:
- switch to random forest model (based upon stack exchange)
- since training data is so unbalanced, take a random supset of "0" click entries equal to the number of "1" entries
	so that the dataset is then balanced.  Do this multiple times with random selection of 0 entries until 
	converge on a value -- may be more indicitive than the unbalanced result
