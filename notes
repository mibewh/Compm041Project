1. what do they mean by "average CTR cases"
    - logical way to seperate it is by advertisers, right now just averaging across the whole set
2. what is the bid price for the average CTR cases
    - should we be looking at bid price or pay price
        - bid price may be more relective of what the advertisiers value the ad spot at
